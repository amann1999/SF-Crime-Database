# COMP3380 DATABASE PROJECT SAN-FRANSISCO POLICE DISTRICT CRIME DATA

## How to Run

First run the sql script (projectIncidents.sql) to populate the data, which will take a few seconds. After the data is populated, do 'make run'

**For our Project, you can select the query you want to run and either dispay the output in a new window (using 'Proceed') or print out the output which will put the output in a output text file.**

**Please make sure to select a query before you click 'Proceed' or 'Download' for the output to display (it might not display if you do not select a query).**

**We are submitting the auth.cfg empty, so please make sure to add your username and password before running the code. Populating the data will not take that long since we do not have a big database.**
